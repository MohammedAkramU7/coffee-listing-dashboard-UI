# Coffee-listing-dashboard-UI

I recently took on a frontend development challenge where I built a coffee listing dashboard using React.js, Vite.js, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to create a reusable card component with dynamic data and implement features like filtering available products and conditional rendering for tags & availability.

What I Learned:
âœ… Improved my React component reusability
âœ… Worked with API data fetching & state management
âœ… Styled efficiently using Tailwind CSS
âœ… Enhanced my ability to build interactive UIs with Vite.js
